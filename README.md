# Statamic Vite Starter Kit

Want to start a new Statamic site with Vite instead of Laravel Mix? Too lazy to migrate yourself? Use this starter kit. It's exactly the statamic/statamic install, just with Vite instead of Mix.

## Installation

Installing is easy. Just [follow the steps in the Statamic docs](https://statamic.dev/starter-kits/installing-a-starter-kit). If you don't like unnecessary files, remove `webpack.mix.js`. Ready to go.
